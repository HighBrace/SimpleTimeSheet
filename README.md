# SimpleTimeSheet
A super simple time sheet app, completely tailored to my needs

The reason to why the Checkout folders for Quick and Nimble are beeing added to my repository is that XCode Server refuses to execute the Integration Bot successfully. All kinds of crappy CodeSigning issues and "permission denied when importing bla bla bla" errors occurs if I try to use prebuilt frameworks. Executing carthage bootstrap as a "before integration trigger" does also not work. This is when the CodeSigning issues appear. Several others seems to be having troubles with this. Only questions to be found, no answers...
